		It's the Thought that Counts
		<div class="giftproject">
			<p>I gave the gift of recycling to my apartment building for this project. My roommates and I have been wanting to recycle since we moved in to the place last year, but unfortunately after contacting our landlord, we were shut down. Since then, our garbage system has changed and our building was given eight brand new tin garbage cans- one per apartment. We tried to stuff all of our bottles and cardboard with the rest of our trash, one can per week just isn&rsquo;t enough room for it all. So, when thinking about this project, solving this small but <span class="emphasis"> relentlessly </span> annoying problem came to mind. So this is a gift for my two roommates, something I know will make their lives a little easier. And help out the planet too.<p></div>
