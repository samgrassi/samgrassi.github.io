		<h2>It's the Thought that Counts<h2>
			<p>I gave the gift of recycling to my apartment building for this project. My roommates and I have been wanting to recycle since we moved in to the place last year, but unfortunately after contacting our landlord, we were shut down. Since then, our garbage system has changed and our building was given eight brand new tin garbage cans- one per apartment. We tried to stuff all of our bottles and cardboard with the rest of our trash, one can per week just isn&rsquo;t enough room for it all. So, when thinking about this project, solving this small but <span class="emphasis"> relentlessly </span> annoying problem came to mind. So this is a gift for my two roommates, something I know will make their lives a little easier. And help out the planet too.<p></div>

			<h3>The Pen is Mightier</h3>
			<p>
				I think its safe to say that fans of The New Yorker have been for years. They recognize the Irvin typeface and are drawn to its charmingly boring aesthetic. They are attracted to its neatly organized layout, to the subtle design it has had for literally decades. Now, I am not an avid reader of The New Yorker. I do not have a subscription, my Android does not have its app, nor do I ever occasionally click through its website. Yet even so, I know the publication for its Irvin typeface, and it&rsquo;s silly little gentleman mascot. I associate it with having class, intelligence and integrity. The New Yorker is iconic. So, when David Remnick, its creative director, decided to make some changes, he was too smart to go full speed ahead with the revamping of the brand&rsquo;s aesthetic. The changes are deliberate and cautious. They&rsquo;re subtle and slow- a term within the context of design that I was unfamiliar with until very recently. This four letter word is what allows real fans to know the ins and outs of their favorite magazine, as well as for outsiders like me to almost inherently have an image of its front cover in mind without ever having read an issue. Slow design has allowed The New Yorker to become the iconic publication that it is today, and the subtly of its changes are in no way an antithesis of this design process. So many big corporations are in this global race to this proverbial, far off finish line for the newest and best names, mottos, logos and visual identities. But The New Yorker&rsquo;s unchanging format has made the case for these companies that focusing on constantly improving is not necessary if you know that what you’ve got from the beginning is just damn good enough to last.

				The magazine&rsquo;s changes are as follows: updating its table of contents, contributers page, Goings On About Town, Briefly Noted and Fiction sections, as well as recutting the Irvin typeface and introducing the typeface Neutraface. Like I said before, I&rsquo;ve never opened an issue of The New Yorker, so I do not have a working knowledge of what the publication looked like prior to these changes, nor am I really all that interested in if they made much of a relevant difference- although I’m sure they did. However, what I do find interesting is Remnick&rsquo;s explanation for and execution of the changes in typeface. The expanded state of awareness- another element of slow design- The New Yorker has as a brand left Remnick going back to the beginning, drawing inspiration from the original characters of Irvin that Ray Irvin drew himself. They were more whimsical in nature, thus the recutting of the current Irvin. The new emblems are reminiscent of the earlier days of the magazine as well.

				Without a hard copy of the magazine, I decided to log onto their website to see these changes for myself. The first thing I noticed was the advertisement at the very top of the page. The size of the title versus the size of the advertisement above it are so similar, that they fight with one another for my attention. The gentleman mascot is also visually fighting with the title The New Yorker. At the size that it is right now, it seems as though having him a bit larger would not only fill up the space in a more interesting way, but solve the issue of dominance between the three (the ad, the title and him). Also, the butterfly on the T in The New Yorker is so small that it begins to lose its definition, and is hard to read as a butterfly. But then again, I am not an avid reader, so perhaps that is why it took me a few seconds of visual analysis to figure out what it was. I think that moving the top, front and center advertisement down to the right hand side of the website where there is additional space would just look neater and more stream-lined. I would assume that a placement like that pays more, but I tend to associate ad-placement like that with websites of a lesser caliber. Other than that minor critique, I find this website to be very user friendly and its design to be very unified. It is organized so that that there is a definitive hierarchical system in place. The typeface used for The New Yorker title, Irvin, is the same used for the titles of each section in the boxes below, but the font size is smaller so that the title can claim dominance and so that there is variation within the design. There are only four colors used in this design: white, black, grey and red. The red is used sparingly, to call attention to a few things that are smaller in size. The box for Subscribe is in red. The largest box on the page directly under title and menu bar, which spotlights certain articles within the section, has that particular section in red Irvin above the title of the article which is black bold Neutraface. The font size is smaller than the article title, which balances and unifies the headers without making them homogenous.

				I am partial to The New Yorker aesthetic. It’s clean and practical. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine what a web layout would look like from the beginning of the publication&rsquo;s timeline, seeing as how the internet is a relatively new endeavor in comparison to The New Yorker&rsquo;s history; however, the content is the same, as are the new changes made to the print editions for the most part. I am sure the design of the website is just as much an indicator of the iconic and timeless nature of this brand, as it is able to function in this digital age while keeping its historical aesthetic integrity in tact.
